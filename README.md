2.6 Independent Geoprocessing Analysis Assignment

## Mapping question:
What Kentucky urban areas are at the highest risk to be directly impacted by wildfires?

## Data utilized:
Urban Area data - KyGovMaps: [Ky City Boundary Polygon](https://opengisdata.ky.gov/datasets/kygeonet::ky-city-boundary-polygon/about)

County data - U.S. Census Bureau: [County and Equivalent](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2023&layergroup=Counties+%28and+equivalent%29) 

State data - U.S. Census Bureau: [State and Equivalent](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2023&layergroup=States+%28and+equivalent%29)

Population data - U.S. Department of Agriculture: [Population estimates for the U.S., States, and counties, 2020â€“22](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.xlsx?v=2419.1)

Wildfire data - U.S. Department of Agriculture: [Fires](https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/catalog/RDS-2013-0009.6)

## Result: 
Both of these maps are of the same area, Eastern Kentucky, the area with the most wildfire activity.

This view of the map is a county aggregate for wildfires in that county. When analyzing this, much of Eastern Kentucky seems to be equally in danger.

When analyzing this data, it could have been easy just to look at the countywide aggregate, but since I was focused on relationships to Urban areas, I chose point data. Hazard, KY - located in Perry County seems to be the highest at risk, based on prior history of wildfire activity in the area.

## Mapping answer:
My main take away is that multiple ways to analyze and visualize data should be done to fully understand what you are researching.
